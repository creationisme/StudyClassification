This [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/wine-quality-dataset/data) is related to red variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. The dataset describes the amount of various chemicals present in wine and their effect on its quality. The data can be used for classification tasks (predicting quality of the wine). It can also be used for regression tasks such as predicting the alcohol level in a given wine. 

This project focuses on various **classification** techniques. I have first performed extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and necessary preprocessing techniques. The dataset is used to compare and contrast various ML classification algorithms: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, Naive Bayes, KNN. I have also trained two neural networks for this classification, with different hyperparameters, to set a baseline. For every ML algorithm, I have run Grid Search to zero in on the best hyperparameters and then compared accuracy of each model.
